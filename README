Simple Bar Conky Theme v. 0.2 by mrmaire <maire.nunez@gmail.com>
A minimalist theme for conky

I've tested this running an up-to-date Manjaro Linux 64bit installation, but I do not know if it works in other distributions.

Installation steps:
====================
1) Put the conkyrc in you ~/.conky folder o install through conky-manager.
2) Make sure your conky version stupport lua and nvidia (Arch and Manjaro: conky-lua-nv)
3) Make sure you've got all the dependencies (hddtemp ...) and they are running (also on startup)
4) Make sure you've installed the fonts
5) Edit the system specific setting, for example your wifi/eth interface

Enjoy!

Updates
====================
 0.1 Initial commit.
 0.2 Covert config file to the new conky 1.10 syntax.
 0.3 Modified the code to correctly display the Nvidia GPU temperature.
